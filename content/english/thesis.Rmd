## Abstract

Functional diversity indices are a staple to the research of ecology and evolutionary biology. New advances are made when researchers publish innovative formulae that capture different aspects of a communityâ€™s functional diversity. This independent project investigates the performances of four different functional diversity indices when they are confronted with randomized Poisson and binomial data distributions. The four indices chosen are community weighted mean, functional dispersion, functional richness, and functional evenness. The randomized data distributions serve as simulations of field sampling errors in species abundances. This research utilized a field-collected dataset of species abundances and functional trait values in a grassland environment. True, original values of the functional diversity indices were calculated using the non-manipulated dataset. Randomizations of Poisson and binomial distributions were employed to manipulate the dataset and to replicate field sampling errors in species abundances. Errant values of the functional diversity indices were then calculated using the manipulated dataset. Simulated Poisson and binomial distributions of community-weighted mean were not different from the expected distributions. Simulated Poisson and binomial distributions of functional evenness were different from their expected distributions. The data analysis suggests that community-weighted mean is the most robust of all the chosen functional diversity indices as its simulated distributions did not deviate from its expected distributions to a significant degree. As such, future researchers should prioritize using community-weighted mean above functional evenness if they are aware of a large amount of error within their collected datasets.

## Introduction

Community ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms within
communities on spatial and temporal scales (Sahney and Benton, 2008). Community ecologists
are tasked with characterizing a community of organisms by studying their interactions with
other organisms around them and their interactions with the environment. This field of ecology
revolves around the designations of species richness and species diversity (Spellerberg and
Fedor, 2003). Species richness measures the number of species within a community, while
species diversity describes the species composition within a community. Ecologists utilize
ecological indices to measure the species richness or species diversity of a community (Grabchak
et al., 2017).
