Welcome to my website! My name is Jeonghoon Lee. Born in Seoul, South Korea, I moved to Canada with my parents when I was five years old.

I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2020, where I received my Honour's Bachelor of Science Degree in Animal Physiology and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology.
