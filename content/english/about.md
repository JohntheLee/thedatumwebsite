Welcome to my website! My name is Jeonghoon Lee, and I’m a fledgling biostatistician. Born in Seoul, South Korea, I moved to Canada with my parents when I was five years old.

I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2020, where I received my Honours Bachelor of Science in Animal Physiology and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. Currently, I am enrolled in the Applied Digital Geography and GIS certificate program at Ryerson University.

Check out the homepage for recent posts. I like to write opinion pieces on a range of biostatistics topics such as Dirichlet process priors, meta-trends in environmental epidemiology, and new R releases.

I like to keep active by hiking or swimming. I’m a mild linguaphile who is currently practicing his Italian. I’m a big music junkie, with my favourite genres being progressive rock and Japanese jazz fusion.
