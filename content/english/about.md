Welcome to my website! My name is Jeonghoon Lee, and I’m a fledgling biostatistician and cloud data architect. Born in Seoul, South Korea, I moved to Canada with my parents when I was five years old.

I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2020, where I received my Honours Bachelor of Science. I really enjoyed learning about parametric methods of statistical analysis and mathematical modelling. I also recently received the Applied Digital Geography and GIS certificate from Ryerson University, learning about database structures and Python programming along the way.

Check out the homepage for recent posts. I like to publish my recent GIS and AWS projects as well as topics regarding biostatistics.

I like to keep active by hiking or swimming. I’m a mild linguaphile who is currently practicing his Italian. I’m also a big music junkie, with my favourite genres being progressive rock and Japanese jazz fusion.
