Our fourth report for CODG212 involved comparing two data interpolation methods: splining and kriging. These interpolation methods have their advantages and disadvantages applicable towards different datasets. This experiment studied which of the two calculations best fit the Meuse river soil contaminant dataset. I also looked at different splining and kriging calculation methods. I compared regularized spline models to tension spline models. I compared spherical kriging models to Gaussian kriging models. Ultimately, I concluded that the Gaussian kriging model best fit the soil contaminant dataset. This kriging model outputted more favourable R, R^2, and RMSE values.
