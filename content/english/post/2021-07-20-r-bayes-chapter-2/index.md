I came across this thought-provoking question while I was going through McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking":

> The Bayesian statistician Bruno de Finetti (1906–1985) began his book on probability theory with the declaration: “PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST.” The capitals appeared in the original, so I imagine de Finetti wanted us to shout this statement. What he meant is that probability is a device for describing uncertainty from the perspective of an observer with limited knowledge; it has no objective reality. Discuss the globe tossing example from the chapter, in light of this statement. What does it mean to say “the probability of water is 0.7”?

Even though I am somewhat familiar with Bayesian statistics and the subjectivity of probability, I had not gone so far as to say that probability itself does not exist. Obviously, probability does indeed exist as a mathematical concept. However, I do understand and agree with de Finetti's finer point in that probability is purely a subjective speculation of the observer and does not matter to the observed.

A cartographer is making a map of a park, filled with both terrestrial and aquatic features. The cartographer points to a specific point on the map, remarking whether the point was land or water. Knowing Bayesian statistics, the probability of the cartographer pointing to a land or water feature exists and shifts constantly as the cartographer is making the point. But, as soon as the point is made, the probability becomes irrelevant as the feature becomes concrete and defined. This is what it means when statisticians say that the probability of x event happening is y value. The y value is the sole concern to the observer and can be ephemeral. Under Bayesian statistics, the observer must ensure that the probability model is secure and does not possess inconsistencies.
