I've learned a lot about the essentials of cloud computing recently. I feel pretty confident in my novice AWS skills, although it will still take a long time to become a master. I've enjoyed going through the cloud practitioner ramp-up guide, completing the self-paced labs and reading the whitepapers. The self-paced labs were particularly enriching. Those tutorials provided an exploratory experience into the essential AWS features. Reading about services like AWS Elastic Compute Cloud was valuable. However, there is no substitution for actually operating and coding yourself. And that is what the self-paced labs provide: an opportunity to play around with the services in a controlled environment.

I learned about configuring AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using CloudFormation templates in either JSON or YAML format. I learned about setting up Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances so that I can employ code. I also learned about AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and how I can use this feature to store objects for later purpose.

I am now on track to completing the ramp-up guide for AWS Solutions Architect. I will try to complete this guide within the month so that I may begin to obtain my Solutions Architect Certification.

I am working on an AWS side-project as well. I am trying to develop a web application that will scrape text off of news websites so that readers such as myself can get the news without cumbersome features that plague websites nowadays (eg. pop-up videos).
