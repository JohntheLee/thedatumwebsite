I was tasked with creating a portfolio of all my works for one of map GIS classes. Now that the classes have finished and the grades released, I can share the link with the public. Working through this assignment, I was amazed at what I could accomplish given only weeks of mentoring and at how crude my first steps were. Alongside each map product, I have added comments regarding the purpose of the map as well as self-criticisms. This is my first time embedding these kinds of links into websites. Hopefully, the portfolio is public-accessible as well as the map products and associated layers.

Google Docs is an online word processor where multiple editors are able to collaborate on a document simultaneously. Would such a concept be possible for GIS software? GIS technicians would be able to add layers and elements as they wish onto a basemap layer and analyze each others work at the same time. Or perhaps the RAM requirements would be too much, especially if the spatial datasets become larger and more overbearing. Nevertheless, I think real-time open collaboration is the next logical step from open source software. Maybe the technology isn't here yet, but we'll get there soon enough I suppose.
