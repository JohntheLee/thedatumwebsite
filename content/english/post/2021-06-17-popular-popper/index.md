The Falsification Principle proposed by Karl Popper is a well-known method of scientific thinking. It predicates on the idea that hypotheses can be labelled scientific if they can be proven false. The classic example is the white swan hypothesis: “All swans are white”. Only one observation of a black swan is needed to prove this hypothesis false.

I believe that Popper’s Falsification Principle is popular because it is taught to us at such an early stage in our academic careers. Do you remember the poster of the scientific model that every science class in elementary school had? The first step in the scientific model is some variation of “formulate the hypothesis”. Students are encouraged to ask questions about anything. Then, a model must be formed to test the hypothesis. The results of this test are finally compared to the original hypothesis. All of these steps cycle into each other like some metaphysical ouroboros. These tenets are taught since grade school. Of course, this over-simplified scientific model is not specific to the Falsification Principle but provides the basis. Popper’s idea appeals to our human nature: our need for order and compartmentalization. If we can systematically reduce possibilities, then we can better understand our surrounding world and its various phenomena.

Yet, Popper’s principle is not without its problems. The ambiguity of the relationship between the hypothesis and the model can lead to no conclusive result and false positives/negatives. What does it truly mean when we prove a hypothesis false? Is it the hypothesis that is wrong or the model with which one used to test it that is wrong?

There is a textbook that I have been recently studying called “Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan” by Richard McElreath that goes into some detail into the shortcomings of the Falsification Principle. This textbook also dives into its alternative: Bayesian theory. I will be posting a short opinion piece or mini-project after every chapter completion.
