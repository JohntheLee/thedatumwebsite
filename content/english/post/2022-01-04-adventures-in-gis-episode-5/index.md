Here is a continuation of my journey through Ryerson's Applied Digital Geography and GIS certificate program. I went through three more classes during the last few months. The first class focused on customizing GIS software using Python code. The second class was all about integrating the tenets of environmental science with GIS. The third class revolved around exploring the techniques of map overlay.

The Python x ArcGis class taught me a lot about building scripts that could streamline the map analysis workflow. Need to rasterize a thousand shapefiles? No problem. Now I can get it done with a couple of lines of Python. This course was a very rewarding excursion into the inner workings of GIS software. I will try to elaborate more on what I accomplished in Episode 6.

Both the environment and map overlay classes taught similar concepts: map algebra, rasterization, classification, and interpolation. However, the map overlay course dove deeper into the statistical side of interpolation. Meanwhile, the environment course focused on enviromental principles such as land and water preservation.

I will post my map outputs and further thoughts from the map overlay class in Episode 7. Episode 8 will be dedicated to the environment ArcGis class.

I am now taking my final class in this certificate program. The class delves into more advanced spatial statistical methods. I am excited to learn about the differences between non-spatial and spatial statistics.
