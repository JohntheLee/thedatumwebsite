I'm pleased to announce that I was able to pass the AWS exam and have earned the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification. I learned a lot about the various AWS microservices during my studies and am excited that I now have something to show for it. Of course, I know that my journey does not stop here. I still have a long ways to go in terms of getting a job in this field. The most common advice that I've received regarding finding employment is to build up a portfolio of projects that showcase relevant skills. I think that I have a good base with my website. I can use my blog here to present projects that I've completed and to announce projects that I'll be working on. Currently, I have projects based on R and Python. I definitely will be working on assignments that show off my AWS skills. I'm excited with this new achievement and for the opportunities that this certification will provide.
