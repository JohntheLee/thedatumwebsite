In order to be productive with my spare time during the Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to enroll myself into an applied GIS certificate program as offered by Ryerson University's Chang School of Continuing Education. I had heard about GIS (or Geographic Information System) before from colleagues at school. How wrong I was to think that GIS was simply about creating colourful and engaging maps. Even a preliminary search revealed that there was a huge spatial analysis aspect to GIS, not to mention the programming and psychological side. I was excited to dive into an entirely new field of advanced statistical analysis. This is the first chapter in a multi-part series regarding my learning progress within the GIS certificate program. I will provide commentary and post my personal map products (at least those that I've deemed good enough to share publicly). I will not be posting academic material or map products of other students.

So far, I'm learning the basics of GIS: foundations of GIS, navigating through popular GIS software, accessing spatial data, and modifying map layers.

Some of my earlier works are definitely rough to look at. Although I'm pretty comfortable using the software (ArcGIS, MapInfo, QGIS), I still have a lot to learn when it comes to generating a useful map. There are lots of aspects to consider: colour theory, balance, purpose, user perception & bias, and spatial analysis.

Hopefully, this is the start of something exciting. I'm eager to learn new topics weekly. The discussions among students and teachers are also very engaging and lively. The argument regarding open-source vs. proprietary licences was particularly interesting. Many good points were raised for both sides, but many agreed that open-source is the future of GIS software.
