For our next report in CODG212, we were tasked with exploring the statistical differences between Global Moran's I analyses and Anselin Local Moran's I analyses. Using the availability of green spaces in Toronto as our biological phenomenon, I determined that global and local spatial statistics do have statistical differences that can again be attributed to the ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit problem.

Here is the copy of my report: https://thedatum-gis.s3.amazonaws.com/LeeJeonghoon_Lab2.pdf

At the time of this post, our class will be more than halfway through the course. Afterwards, I will be able to obtain my GIS certificate.
