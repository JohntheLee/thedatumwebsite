CODG212 is the last course I need to complete my Applied Digital Geography and GIS certificate. This course teaches us about spatial statistical methods and how to employ them in ArcGIS Pro. The beginning of this course taught us to think about the ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit problem. The ecological fallacy is the wrongful notion that biological phenomenon that exists at one spatial scale will continue to exist at another spatial scale. The modifiable areal unit problem is a source of statistical bias that can affect spatial statistical hypotheses.

A topical example would be the concept of gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the act of manipulating political boundaries to secure votes in favour of one party. Politicians have long employed gerrymandering to sway the voting populace. This political concept is closely tied to the ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit problem. Our professor for this course wanted us to explore these two concepts further in a brief scientific report. I really appreciated this assignment format as this technical report leaves room for individual exploration and investigation. Previous courses involved assignments with rigid directions almost to the point of hand-holding. Although the data manipulation steps in this course are definitely detailed (possibly to eliminate deviations and confusion), the interpretation of the data is up to the author.

I have attached my copy of this assignment here in my post. I believe that I won't be violating any academic misconducts by doing so as the deadline for this specific assignment is long past due, and we have all received our grades and feedback.

In the spirit of my other ongoing pursuit in learning Amazon Web Services (AWS), I have opted to host my report within a publicly available Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket: https://thedatum-gis.s3.amazonaws.com/LeeJeonghoon_Lab1.pdf
