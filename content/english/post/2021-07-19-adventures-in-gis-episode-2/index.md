Recently, we've been exploring design concepts and what each theme requires in terms of cartographic elements. What would be the statistical benefits of using pie charts over bar graphs? What kinds of biases would different types of classification techniques introduce into choropleth maps?

I do have some reservations using either bar graphs or pie charts. In all of my undergraduate statistics courses, I was taught that pie charts are virtually unusable because of their inability to communicate statistical information clearly. Proportional sizes may be manipulated to be distinct, but are they really that precise? Also, I don't think our eyes are that good at discerning pie wedge proportions. I believe that bar graphs without clearly labeled axes can be misleading. I understand that sometimes axes must be exempted for visual clarity. However, in the grand scheme of things, I think accurate and unbiased statistical reporting is more important than visual standards.

We also learned that different categorizations of data can result in different perceptions. If one classified a dataset by quantiles instead of by natural breaks, then perhaps the dataset might appear left-skewed. What is the most efficient and neutral classification technique? Should there be such a standard? The problem with standardization is that all datasets are different, an the classification technique must suit the specific dataset used.
