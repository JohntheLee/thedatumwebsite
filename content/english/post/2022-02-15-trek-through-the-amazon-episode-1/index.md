This is just going to be a short post today summarizing the various cloud computing concepts that I've learned while studying for the AWS Solutions Architect & Developer certification exams.

I've made a trial account for AWS. This free-tier account lets me play around with some critical AWS features, such as creating Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instances. I've learned some important lessons regarding protecting identities by creating admin accounts and not utilizing root access. I've been able to setup the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and played around with AWS's own IDE: Cloud9. I just learned some basic things about Infrastructure as Code, using the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and the CLI to deploy a VPC that spread across two Availability Zones in my Region.

I've spent the last two weeks reading up on the five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization. Now it is time to go through the ramp-up guides, learning plans, and well-architected labs in order to dive head-first into cloud computing.

There is such a plethora of AWS features that it feels overwhelming. Thankfully, this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIbIYCM48to) really helped me in understanding what some of the key (and some of the cool!) features do. The video is quite tongue-in-cheek. But, the quality and clarity of the presentation really shine through.
