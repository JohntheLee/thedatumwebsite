What makes humans special? This is a question that I've often wondered during my university days studying animal physiology and ecology. Any anatomical features that we possess are outclassed by those of other animals. Even our sense of time is rivaled by the seasonal instincts to which migrating species adhere. So what separates us from them? I believe that what makes the human race truly unique is our desire to express ourselves through art. Our innate desire to define our culture makes us immortal through time.

Animals act for the most part to survive. To lead their lives so that they may survive to see their offspring grow. We act to live. To do all that the animals do and to find the time so that we may enjoy each other's company and share our talents and skills. No other animal paints a picture of their hunt upon the cave wall. No other animal sculpts a likeness of themselves out of stone. No other animal establishes their own unique culture with beliefs and creeds.

Of course, this discussion is open for improvement and change. There is a good argument to be had regarding our scientific endeavours.
